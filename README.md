# Meeting Concluder

This application can record and then summarize meetings automatically. The summary and conclusion can optionally be sent to a Slack channel of your choosing.

Created in connection with the 2023 Hackdays.

## Getting started

* Install the required dependencies (portaudio, ffmpeg and Go 1.16 or later).
* Configure your Slack web hook URL either as the `SLACK_EBHOOK_URL` environment variable, or as `slack_webhook = "YOUR SLACK WEBHOOK URL GOES HERE"` in `~/.config/concluder.toml`.
* Configure your OpenAI API Key either as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_KEY` environment variable, or as `openai_api_key = "YOUR KEY GOES HERE"` in `~/.config/concluder.toml`.
* Make sure that you have a working microphone.

Clone the repository and run the server (which includes a frontend):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/schibsted/meeting-concluder.git
cd hackday-meeting-concluder/cmd/backend/backend
go build -mod=vendor
./backend
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

A double clap can be used to stop the recording.

Note that the current maximum audio file size for the transcription API is 25 MiB, which is not a lot. Pull requests for adding batching are welcome.

## Project contents

* A Go package named `concluder`.
* A web server with REST endpoints and a web frontend.
* Several command line utilities, which were used for testing.

* `cmd/audio2text/audio2text` was used for converting `cmd/wav2mp4/output.wav` to `cmd/audio2text/output.txt`.
* `cmd/conclude/conclude` was used for converting `cmd/audio2text/output.txt` to `cmd/conclude/output.txt`.
